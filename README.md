# The Silver Twilight Lodge
A strategy game of most dire import.

## Care to join us?
Carl Sanford pulls you aside. "Quite the party tonight eh? Absolutely everybody of means is here tonight." He gestures at the ball room where men in suits sip their brandy and discuss business in hushed tones.

"You have made an impression on some of us you know. You might have what it takes to join our club. You will find that when it comes to ruling this world, and others, nobody does it quite like we do." He smiles a sinister smile and takes a long drag on his cigar before extending a cold hand in your direction.

## Amass Wealth
You need to amass wealth to stay in the club. You can do this by flipping a company for a quick profit, or perhaps you will deal with the Rum Runners and risk arrest to move some bootleg hooch.

## Amass Power
It takes power, influence, and connections to rule the business world. Will you try your luck at a social soiree, or perhaps you prefer more sinister methods and will deal with the Unspeakable Nighmares that dwell, chained with cold iron, in the basement of the Club...

## Don't Lose
If your money or power reaches 0, Carl will escort you out of the club. Will you be lucky enough to simply walk out the front door?
